# Codeforces Solutions

Welcome to my repository of programming solutions for various problems on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). This repo serves as a curated archive of my accepted solutions, coded during practice and contests. It is meant both for personal reference and to share approaches with the programming community.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Each folder is named after its respective Codeforces contest number or problem set.
- Solution files follow the problem code or name (e.g., `A.java`).
- Source code is written in:
  - Java

## 🌟 Objectives

- **Practice Efficiently:** Track my progress and revisit old problems.
- **Learn & Improve:** Explore different algorithms and problem-solving techniques.
- **Share Knowledge:** Provide clean, well-documented solutions for others to reference.
